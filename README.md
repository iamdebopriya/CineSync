Movie Recommendation App
Welcome to the Movie Recommendation App repository! This project leverages advanced content-based recommendation techniques to provide users with personalized movie suggestions from the TMDB 5000 movie database.

Key Features
Content-Based Recommendation: Our algorithm recommends movies based on the content features of the movies, such as genre, keywords, and overview, ensuring that users receive suggestions tailored to their tastes.

Stemming Methods: To enhance the accuracy of our recommendations, we apply stemming techniques to normalize text data, allowing the algorithm to better understand and match movie descriptions.

Cosine Similarity: We utilize cosine similarity to measure the similarity between movies. This mathematical approach ensures that the recommendations are precise and relevant.

Top 10 Movie Recommendations: For any given movie, our app provides a list of the top 10 most similar movies from the extensive TMDB 5000 movie database, offering users a variety of options to explore.
How It Works
Data Preprocessing: The movie data is preprocessed using stemming methods to ensure consistency and improve the accuracy of the content-based filtering.
Feature Extraction: Relevant features such as genres, keywords, and overviews are extracted from the movie dataset.
Cosine Similarity Calculation: The cosine similarity between the feature vectors of the movies is computed to determine the most similar movies.
Recommendation Generation: Based on the cosine similarity scores, the top 10 most similar movies are recommended to the user.
Technologies Used
Python: The primary programming language for implementing the recommendation algorithm.
Pandas & NumPy: For data manipulation and numerical operations.
Scikit-Learn: For implementing the cosine similarity.
NLTK: For natural language processing and stemming.
